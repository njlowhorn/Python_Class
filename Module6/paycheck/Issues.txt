To figure out why the people in the csv file weren't being added to the stack, I used echoes to print out the head in both the push and pop methods to see what was happening. That's when I realized that the people were actually being added. Eventually, I noticed that, in the hours prompt, within the pop function, the name of the class was being called, instead of the employee. This just made it appear that only the "bossman" was in the stack. So, I changed "self.name" to "top.name." 
As for the "None" that kept printing after each prompt, the issue turned out to be that this was a result from trying to print the pop method. I decided to just call the method and print the return from the pay function, along with some additional formatting I added too.
Also, I had to divide the deductions by 100 to get the decimal.
Finally, my program kept crashing after the last prompt. The error said that "head.next" was a "NoneType" in the pop method. The problem was the while loop that was calling it: it was running after all of the people in the stack had been removed. It needed to check that if "boss.next" wasn't None, instead of "boss" itself.
